=====================
This game is done as part of Object-Oriented JavaScript course at Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/ud015.

To run the game open index.html in browser or open demo page http://korneevaed.github.io/frogger-clone.

You can move the character with arrow keys: up, down, left, right. One key press moves character to next square. E.g. left arrow will move it one square left, etc.

Aim is to gain the highest score.

Scores are achieved by collecting the gems. Gems collection give following scores:
for orange: 10 points,
for green: 20 points,
for blue: 30 points.

Character dies if it meets one of the bugs runnings across the screen. Score thus is set to 0, character appears at start position (bottom of game field) and game starts again.
